- Indendation should not be more than 4 spaces. The default value for the indendation is 4 spaces.

- Line Length: Many Python programmers recommend that each line should be less than 80 characters. 

- Comments Length: PEP 8 also recommends that you limit all of your comments to 72 characters per line.
